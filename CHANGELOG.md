# WIP
Changes:
* Feature: Dying creatures now drop their inventory.
* Bug: Dying as you go into your inventory no longer leaves the game in a weird state.
* Bug: Look UI has been repositioned to match the new UI design.
* Bug: You can no longer spawn in a creature - no creatures spawned in first room.
* Bug: Dependency updates to run on Arch Linux (thanks @Andr√©).

# v0.0.1
Initial release.
