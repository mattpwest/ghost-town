# Ghost Town

This is my first remotely succesful attempt at making a Roguelike. It was made during [/r/roguelikedev Does The Complete Roguelike Tutorial (2019)](https://old.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/cmmdid/roguelikedev_does_the_complete_roguelike_tutorial/).

The concept is simple: you are a ghost... your essence is slowly slipping away. Possess monsters in the dungeon and use their bodies to kill other monsters so you can steal the essence from their departing souls!

Currently you lose the game by running out of essence and there's no way to win yet. There's also only the one starting level, which is still fairly close to just the basics introduced by the tutorial, so the first release is there simply to allow you to try out the possession mechanic.
